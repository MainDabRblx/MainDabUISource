# MainDab UI Source Code
This is the source code for MainDab's UI (the exploit itself), so yea. It contains everything I have done so far. I don't update it that much, but I'll try do it from time to time. 

I don't recommend using my UI since the code itself is quite messy. If you do want to use it, contact me on Discord at Main_EX#3898. Once again, join my discord if my username is incorrect or you doubt the validity of the person you're talking to.

Anyways, enjoy I guess. MainDab isn't even obfuscated in the first place. Make sure to join MainDab at https://discord.io/maindab
