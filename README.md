# MainDab UI Source Code
This is the source code for MainDab's UI (the exploit itself), so yea. It contains everything I have done so far. I update it from time to time, usually every time I update MainDab.

I don't recommend using my UI since the code itself is quite messy, and it's also in WPF. This repository is meant to be more of a backup. It's literally the WORST SOURE CODE you could find. If you do want to use it, contact me on Discord at Main_EX#3898. Once again, join my discord if my username is incorrect or you doubt the validity of the person you're talking to. I'm also kinda shitty at C# so don't expect any optimisations or shit. 

MainDab also isn't obfuscated if you're skeptical about this source code lol

Anyways, enjoy I guess. MainDab isn't even obfuscated in the first place lol. Make sure to join MainDab at https://discord.io/maindab
